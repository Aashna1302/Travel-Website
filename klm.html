The purpose of the klm travel hub is to save airlines money and give passengers better routes to destinations. 
Airplanes are an airline's most valuable commodity, and every flight has certain set costs. Each seat on the plane represents a portion 
of the total flight cost. For each seat that is filled by a passenger, an airline lowers its break-even price, which is the seat price at which an 
airline stops losing money and begins to show a profit on the flight</p></font>
